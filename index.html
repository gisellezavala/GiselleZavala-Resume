        <div class="subheading mb-5">Sociology MajorðŸ¦”</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My current part-time job is the first job that I've been working for a little over a year now! It began on May 18, 2022, at Jersey Mikes, which I still work at. I have grown to love what I do and appreciate the people I work with! For working there only a little over a year now, I feel like Iâ€™ve learned so many things that contribute to my everyday life. Before I started working there, I was very outspoken and shy, yet working at Jersey Mikes helped me find my voice and become more talkative. Even though it's still a work in progress, I am not the person I was before working there! Even the friends and crew I'm now a part of helped contribute to that. Working at Jersey Mikes helped me grow to love working in customer service. I've had no issues with my job, as to why I've put in a little over a year of my time working there. The job has grown on me and taught me valuable working traits.<br><br>
        In the future, I'd like to work with children. I find that's where my heart is right now. While attending UCR, I want to major in Sociology and minor in Child Development or Education to work with little ones in the future! As of right now, I've been attending this church with my family for as long as I can remember, and they have allowed me to gain experience by volunteering to help watch and teach their Sunday class of children seven years old and younger. My tasks were helping to watch over the children, assisting with their snack time, helping them with the arts and crafts that I prepared for them that day, and even cleaning after the class was done. So far, I enjoy looking forward to every Sunday being able to help with the children. They're all adorable, and I could see myself teaching and working with little ones in the future!<br><br>
        And while I go through the motions of adjusting to college Life, I plan to keep my mind open to new ideas of opportunities to expand what I might enjoy other than just working with children. Since it isn't a set goal, I wouldn't mind ever considering changing my major and career path. What I aim for at the end of the day is to find something I take an interest in and want to be a part of, whether that's working with children or helping the elderly in any way that I can, being in a retirement home or even the social work field. When I think of my future career, I'd like to do something that will involve helping others. I take all the responsibility when people ask me for help, going that extra mile to make it my own business and helping them to the best of my ability! Even with my current part-time job and volunteering with children, I go toward those attributes by assisting other people and children!
